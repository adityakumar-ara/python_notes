Set :- A set is a collection in Python.


 It has the following features:
It is unordered
It is unindexed
It cannot contain duplicate elements
It stores only unique elements
It is mutable


Example:
set   = {11, 22, 33, 44, 55,“Ujjwal”,“Ravi”,5.2}




Duplicate Removal in Set
my_set = {11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 11, 22, 33}
print("this is actual elements of this set :", my_set)


Output
this is actual elements of this set : {33, 11, 44, 22, 55}


Duplicate values (11, 22, 33) were removed automatically by the set.

Set Methods

1. add() – Add a Single Element
my_set = {11, 22, 33, 55, 44, 2}
print("before adding element :", my_set)

my_set.add(77)
print("after adding element  :", my_set)


Output
before adding element : {33, 2, 11, 44, 22, 55}
after adding element  : {33, 2, 11, 44, 77, 22, 55}



2. update() – Add Multiple Elements
my_set = {11, 22, 33, 55, 44, 2}
print("before adding element :", my_set)

my_set.update({77, 999, 102})
print("after adding element  :", my_set)


Output
before adding element : {33, 2, 11, 44, 22, 55}
after adding element  : {33, 2, 102, 999, 11, 44, 77, 22, 55}



3. remove() – Remove a Specific Element
my_set = {11, 22, 33, 55, 44, 2}
print("before removing element :", my_set)

my_set.remove(22)
print("after removing element  :", my_set)


Output
before removing element : {33, 2, 11, 44, 22, 55}
after removing element  : {33, 2, 11, 44, 55}



Set Does NOT Support Indexing
my_set = {11, 22, 33, "rahul", "ravi", 8.8}
print("before operation :", my_set)

# print(my_set[4])   # ERROR → sets do not support indexing


Output
before operation : {'rahul', 33, 8.8, 11, 22, 'ravi'}


(Attempting to access my_set[4] will raise an error.)


Loop Through a Set
my_set = {11, 22, 33, "rahul", "ravi", 8.8}
print("before iteration :", my_set)

for i in my_set:
    print(i)


Output
before iteration : {'rahul', 33, 8.8, 11, 22, 'ravi'}
rahul
33
8.8
11
22
ravi



Order may vary because sets are unordered.

Practice:
pop() => remove random element from a set
discard()  =>
clear()
